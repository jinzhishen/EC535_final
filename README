In the video, the top button on the board is BNT 0 where it is able to swtich betwee "Normal", "Fleshing red", "Fleshing yellow" mods;

The bottom button is BNT 1 where is it able to only provides pedastrain crossing when pressed in Normal mod

In out design, when the pedastrain pressed BNT1 when green light in Normal is on, we need to wait for the green cycle end and that is when the 

pedastrain is "waiting" and the the other two lights on mod is processing the status is "crossing". Note that we didn't show "crossing" when red flashing

because we coudln't determine when fleshing red/yellow a pedastrain is present. (They are allow to cross but there isn't necessary a person present at the time)
